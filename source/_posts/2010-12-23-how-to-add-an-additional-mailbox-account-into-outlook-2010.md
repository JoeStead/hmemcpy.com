I just had to go through an ordeal &ndash; adding an additional mailbox to my Outlook account. I always forget how to do it, and it frustrates me to no end that there's no easier way (to my knowledge) to do this.

I will use Outlook 2010, but I assume it works the same in the previous versions.

  1. Go to your Account Settings: press the **File** tab, click the **Account Settings** button, and another **Account Settings** button:

  2. In the **E-mail** tab of Account Settings dialog, double click your Exchange profile. In the new dialog that will popup, press **More Settings**.
  3. In yet another dialog that will open up, go to the **Advanced** tab, and add another mailbox using the **Add** button.
  4. Close all dialogs. Your mailbox should appear on the Home tab now:
