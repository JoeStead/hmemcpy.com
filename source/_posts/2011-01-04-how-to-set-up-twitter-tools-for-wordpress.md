I am using the [Twitter Tools](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/) plugin for WordPress to automatically publish new blog posts on Twitter. When installing the plugin, it gives very clear instructions as to how to register the blog with Twitter, however it seemed that some information was missing &ndash; specifically the Access Token, required to complete the installation.

**Important:** If you're using Chrome, disable the [Always https (for Facebook and Twitter)](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/glhcelomhfgefggmfhenemjhhjocmioo) extension if installed, otherwise it will force the app registration page to use **https**://twitter.com instead of http://dev.twitter.com, and you will not be able to complete part 3 &ndash; the *My Access Token* page will be missing.

After connecting your blog to Twitter, re-enable the extension.
