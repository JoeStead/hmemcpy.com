Since posting my [rant](/2011/11/the-horror-of-call-of-duty-elite-website/) on the Call of Duty Elite Website, I've been getting a lot of hits on the blog from people struggling with the *Age Gate* page of the website. If for some reason you enter the wrong date of birth at the signup page, you will not be able to return to the signup to enter a new date, and get the *Age Gate Failed* page instead.

<!-- more -->

This happens because the Call of Duty Elite website stores the date in a cookie in your browser, and if you failed to meet the minimum age requirement, will not let you proceed. To bypass this, and return to the registration page you will simply need to _delete the cookies_ from your browser, either all cookies, or just the ones for callofduty.com. After that, reload the website with Ctrl-F5, and try signing up again. Good luck!
